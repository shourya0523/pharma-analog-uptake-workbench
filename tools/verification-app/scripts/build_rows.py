"""Build the rows, priority tiers, notes and batches the verification app serves.

Reads the published gold dataset and writes one JSON file:

    python tools/verification-app/scripts/build_rows.py [--out PATH]

Every row in gold that cites a source is served: quarterly, annual and
companion figures, and the evidence behind each exclusion (see gold_rows()).
Rows for products off the requested list (docs/sourcing/target_products.csv)
are served too, marked "not on requested list". A row's tier says
how much rides on it; its note says what in the document makes it easy to
misread. Both are derived from the row and its series, so a rebuild of gold
re-derives them.

This is a gold-side tool. Nothing the pipeline reads may come from here
(CLAUDE.md rule 3), and backend/tests/test_verification_app_is_not_an_input.py
checks the pipeline never names it.
